This Python script consists of two code cells designed to automate the interpolation process for N fields of a point feature class using the geostatistical Kriging method and the deterministic Radial Basis Functions method. Additionally, it requires a polygon feature class, which will serve as both a mask and an extent for the interpolation.
The script includes detailed instructions on which parameters need to be replaced and which ones should be adjusted based on the user's specific requirements. Furthermore, it contains error-handling code snippets to facilitate debugging and ensure a smoother workflow.
